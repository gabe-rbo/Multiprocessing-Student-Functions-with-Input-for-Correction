# Multiprocessing-Student-Functions-with-Input-for-Correction
This is a more advanced version of my last post. Here, we define a more volatile process communicator, adaptable by arguments to the exercices, capable of communicating input to the process and filtering the output. 
There are certain differences: most of the code is in English (except the funcoes_exercicios.py file, it was created by my advisor, so it is in portuguese, but it only contains the exercises, so it's not that important to read it), this version catches execution time, is more rigorous with Pool and prints the results with a (somewhat) more pleasing string.

It's quite okay to understand, not very much so if you haven't read the test version, so i recommend reading it. (https://github.com/gabe-rbo/Multiprocessing-Sum-With-User-Input)
